# OBJECT-DETECTION-USING-YOLO_V8
* The main objective of this project is to build a deep learning model which can detect an object in real time.
* This research work uses yolo v8 algorithm including some data set and finally by using this algorithm we can detect the object in real time.
* Here it recognize multiple objects in a single image, not only to return the confidence score but also predict the corresponding bounding boxes.

# INTRODUCTION
* YOLO is an abbreviation for the term ‘You Only Look Once’. This is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in a picture (in real-time). YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects in real-time and “yolo v8 has it has overall 24 convolutional layers and for image training we should have an image size of 320×320, 352×352, … and 608×608.
* This approach uses a single neural network to process the entire picture, then separates it into parts and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each component

# REQUIREMENTS
* Google colab
* Python (minimum version of 3.11.2)
